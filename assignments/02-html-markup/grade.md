## Comments
Overall great, just a few small things to clean up in your code (See notes in index.html).

Your file organization needs some fixing. You have an extra sub folder (`mad9013`) in your repo that is not needed. Immediately in your repo I should see the following folder structure:

/assignments/
  /02-html-markup/
    index.html
/in-classes/
  /03-buttons/
    index.html
    /css/
      main.css
/images/
