## Comments
Overall great! A couple things:
- The logo should have an `<h1>` in it on the home page.
- There is an error on line 35 of your CSS Reset. You are missing the  `,` after `Roboto`. You have: `font-family: Roboto sans-serif;` and it should be `font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;`. This is causing your font to not load in all of your patterns.
